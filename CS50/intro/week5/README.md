# CS50 Week 5 â€“ Data Structures

This folder contains my assignments for Week 5 of CS50: Introduction to Programming.

## Overview
Week 5 focuses on **data structures and efficient storage/retrieval of data in C**.  
Key concepts covered:  
- Structs and linked lists  
- Hash tables and simple hash functions  
- File I/O for large datasets  
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`)  
- Case-insensitive string handling  

## Assignments
### 1. Inheritance
- Program that demonstrates inheritance-like behavior in C using structs and pointers.  
- Creates a base struct and derived structs to simulate object-oriented inheritance.  
- Key concepts:  
  - Structs with embedded pointers to simulate inheritance  
  - Function pointers for polymorphic behavior  
  - Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)  
  - Passing structs to functions  

### 2. Speller
- Program that checks the spelling of a text file using a dictionary.  
- Loads a dictionary into memory using a hash table of linked lists, checks each word in a text file, and reports misspelled words.  
- Key concepts:  
  - Linked lists and node insertion  
  - Hash tables and hash functions  
  - File I/O (`fopen`, `fscanf`)  
  - Case-insensitive string comparison  
  - Dynamic memory allocation and proper freeing of memory
