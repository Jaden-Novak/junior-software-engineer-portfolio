# CS50 Week 6 â€“ Python, File I/O, and Algorithms

This folder contains my assignments for **Week 6** of CS50: Introduction to Programming.

## Overview
Week 6 focuses on **Python programming**, with an emphasis on:
- File Input/Output (I/O)
- Parsing CSV files
- Implementing algorithms
- Working with command-line arguments

## Assignments

### 1. Hello
- A Python program that prints "Hello, world!" to the terminal.
- Key concepts: basic Python syntax, printing to console.

### 2. Mario
- A Python program that simulates the "Mario" pyramid, allowing the user to specify the height of the pyramid.
- Key concepts: loops, conditionals, user input handling.

### 3. Credit
- A Python program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
- Key concepts: loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations.

### 4. Readability
- A Python program that computes the readability of a text using the Coleman-Liau index.
- Key concepts: loops, conditionals, string manipulation.

### 5. DNA
- A Python program that analyzes a DNA sequence to identify a person based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).
- Reads a CSV database of people and their STR counts.
- Reads a DNA sequence from a text file.
- Computes the longest consecutive repeats of each STR in the sequence and compares them with the database.
- Key concepts: file I/O, CSV parsing, dictionaries, loops, functions, algorithmic problem-solving.

## Usage

### Hello, Mario, Credit, Readability
Run hello.py, mario.py, credit.py, and readability.py from the command line.
Run dna.py from the command line with two arguments: the database CSV and the sequence text file.

```bash
python hello.py
python mario.py
python credit.py
python readability.py
python dna.py database.csv sequence.txt
